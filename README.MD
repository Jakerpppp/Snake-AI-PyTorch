# Snake AI PyTorch Project

## Overview
This project represents my foray into the world of artificial intelligence (AI) using Python and PyTorch. Inspired by the classic game of Snake, I embarked on this journey to visualize and understand how reinforcement learning and deep learning can be applied in a practical, engaging context. Following a tutorial, I gained a foundational understanding of PyTorch and the implementation of AI in Python. I really wanted to see a real example that I could code of AI learning, to inspire me on the path of AI. Uses Deep Q Learning and Neural Networks.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- pygame

## Project Description
In this project, I developed an AI that learns to play the Snake game. The goal was to use this simple yet intriguing environment to observe the mechanics of reinforcement learning and deep Q learning in action. By training a neural network to navigate the game, I was able to gain insights into the decision-making processes of AI.

##Â Key Learning Outcomes
Gained a basic understanding of PyTorch and its application in AI.
Explored the concepts of reinforcement learning and deep learning.
Developed a hands-on project that consolidates theoretical knowledge into practical skills.
Uses Deep Q Learning and Neural Networks.

## Motivation
My primary motivation behind this project was to visualize how reinforcement learning and deep learning work in a tangible way. The Snake game provided a perfect platform to see these concepts in action. This project has been a significant learning experience, laying the groundwork for my journey into AI and deep learning.

## Future Aspirations
This project has sparked a deep interest in AI, and I am keen to delve deeper into this field. It has inspired me to access more resources and build a robust understanding of the fundamentals of AI. I am excited to take on more projects like this, furthering my knowledge and skills in AI and PyTorch.
